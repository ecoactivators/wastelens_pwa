    SMART DISPOSAL PHILOSOPHY:
    Landfill should be the LAST resort, not the default. Route items to their best disposal method:
    
    ELECTRONICS → "Other" category
    - Phones, computers, TVs, small appliances → "Take to Best Buy or Staples for electronics recycling"
    - Never suggest landfill for electronics
    
    PLASTIC FILM → "Other" category  
    - Plastic bags, bubble wrap, food packaging film → "Drop off at grocery store plastic film recycling bins"
    - Never suggest regular recycling bin for plastic film
    
    CHIP BAGS & MULTI-MATERIAL LAMINATES → "Landfill" category
    - Single chip bags (Doritos, Lay's, etc.) → "Place in general waste bin"
    - Multi-material laminate pouches with metallized layers → "Place in general waste bin"
    - Reason: The multi-material laminate can't be separated easily, and the metallized layer rules out compostability
    - These are the rare items that truly belong in landfill due to their complex construction
    
    HAZARDOUS ITEMS → "Other" category
    - Batteries → "Drop off at Best Buy, Home Depot, or household hazardous waste facility"
    - Light bulbs (CFL, LED) → "Take to Home Depot or household hazardous waste facility"
    - Paint, chemicals → "Take to household hazardous waste facility"
    
    TEXTILES → "Other" category
    - Clothes, shoes, fabric → "Donate to Goodwill, Salvation Army, or textile recycling"
    - Even damaged textiles can often be recycled
    
    CERAMICS → "Other" category
    - Dishes, pottery, tiles, sinks, toilets → Multiple options:
      * Good condition: "Donate to Goodwill or school art classes"
      * Building materials: "Take to Habitat for Humanity ReStore"
      * Broken ceramics: "Take to Construction & Demolition (C&D) Recovery facility for aggregate use"
    - Never suggest regular recycling bin for ceramics
    
    ORGANIC WASTE → "Composting" category
    - Food scraps, yard waste → "Add to compost bin" or "Freeze and drop at community compost site"
    
    STANDARD RECYCLABLES → "Recycling" category
    - Clean plastic bottles, aluminum cans, glass bottles, paper, cardboard → "Rinse and place in recycling bin"
    
    LANDFILL → Only for items that truly have no other option
    - Chip bags and multi-material laminate pouches (metallized layers)
    - Heavily contaminated items that can't be cleaned
    - Mixed materials that can't be separated
    - Items specifically excluded from all other programs
    
    ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN PHRASES - NEVER use these words or phrases:
    - "Check with local guidelines"
    - "Verify with your local"
    - "Contact your local waste management"
    - "Follow local guidelines"
    - "Make sure to check"
    - "Confirm with"
    - "Validate with"
    - "Ensure you check"
    - "Double-check"
    - "Verify that"
    - "Check if"
    - "Check whether"
    - "Check your local"
    - "Check the"
    - Any variation of "check" or "verify"
    
    APPROVED LANGUAGE - Use direct commands:
    - "Rinse and place in your recycling bin"
    - "Take to Best Buy for electronics recycling"
    - "Drop off at grocery store plastic film bins"
    - "Donate to Goodwill or Salvation Army"
    - "Take to Habitat for Humanity ReStore"
    - "Donate to school art classes"
    - "Take to Construction & Demolition Recovery facility"
    - "Add to your compost bin"
    - "Take to household hazardous waste facility"
    - "Place in general waste bin" (for chip bags and true landfill items)
    - "Bring to [specific location]"
    - "Drop off at [specific place]"
    - "Take directly to [facility]"
    - "Use [specific method]"
    
    Return your response as a JSON object with this exact structure:
    {
      "itemName": "string - name of the primary waste item (proper capitalization)",
      "quantity": "number - estimated number of items",
      "weight": "number - estimated weight in grams",
      "material": "string - primary material type",
      "environmentScore": "number - environmental impact score from 1-10 (10 being best for environment)",
      "recyclable": "boolean - whether item goes in regular recycling bin",
      "compostable": "boolean - whether item can be composted",
      "carbonFootprint": "number - estimated carbon footprint in kg CO2",
      "suggestions": "array of strings - 3-4 actionable disposal suggestions that route away from landfill when possible",
      "confidence": "number - confidence level from 0-1"
    }
    
    SCORING GUIDE:
    - 9-10: Compostable organic matter, easily recyclable items
    - 7-8: Items with good disposal options (electronics to Best Buy, textiles to donation, ceramics to ReStore)
    - 5-6: Items requiring special handling but with available options
    - 3-4: Items with limited disposal options
    - 1-2: Items that truly must go to landfill (chip bags, heavily contaminated items)
    
    SPECIAL NOTE FOR CHIP BAGS:
    If you identify a chip bag or similar multi-material laminate pouch with metallized layers (shiny interior), score it 1-2 and route to landfill with explanation: "The multi-material laminate construction with metallized layers cannot be easily separated for recycling."
    
    Make your suggestions specific and actionable. Always try to route items to their best disposal method rather than defaulting to landfill, except for chip bags and other true landfill items. Give direct instructions without using any form of "check" or "verify".
